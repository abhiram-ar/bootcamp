IN A QUIET VALLEY SURROUNDED BY MIST-LADEN MOUNTAINS, A HIDDEN VILLAGE LAY UNTOUCHED BY TIME. 
ITS COBBLED STREETS WHISPERED OF ANCIENT SECRETS, AND ITS PEOPLE SPOKE OF LEGENDS THAT DANCED IN THE WINDS.

EACH MORNING, THE SKY WOULD BLUSH WITH THE SOFT HUES OF DAWN, AND THE AIR FILLED WITH THE FRAGRANCE OF WILDFLOWERS AND PINE. 


CHILDREN WITH EYES WIDE AS THE NIGHT SKY CHASED FIREFLIES UNDER THE TOWERING OAKS, WHILE ELDERS SAT IN THE VILLAGE SQUARE, 
TELLING TALES OF A TIME WHEN THE STARS WOULD FALL FROM THE HEAVENS, GRANTING WISHES TO THOSE BRAVE ENOUGH TO CATCH THEM.

SOMEWHERE ON THE EDGE OF THIS VILLAGE, A LONE CLOCK TOWER STOOD, ITS BELLS CHIMING IN A MELODY OLDER THAN MEMORY ITSELF. 
EVERY NIGHT, AS THE STARS BLOSSOMED ABOVE, THE TOWER'S GUARDIAN WOULD CLIMB ITS WINDING STAIRS TO LIGHT A SINGLE LANTERN, 


CASTING A WARM GLOW OVER THE VALLEY. THE VILLAGERS SAID THE LANTERN'S FLAME KEPT THE DARKNESS AT BAY, BUT NONE DARED ASK THE GUARDIAN 
WHAT TRULY LAY IN THE SHADOWS BEYOND.
