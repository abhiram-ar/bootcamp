Basic Mapping:
Given an array of numbers, double each number using map().

String Transformation:
Given an array of strings, capitalize the first letter of each string using map().

Array of Objects Transformation:
Given an array of objects representing people with name and age properties, create a new array containing only the names of these people using map().

Array Index Access:
Given an array of numbers, create a new array where each element is the original number multiplied by its index in the array using map().

Array Filtering and Mapping:
Given an array of numbers, create a new array containing only the even numbers, and double each even number using map().

Nested Array Transformation:
Given a 2D array of numbers, transform it into a new 2D array where each number is squared using map().

Using Map with Other Array Methods:
Given an array of strings, filter out the strings that contain fewer than 5 characters, and capitalize the first letter of each remaining string using map().

Mapping with Conditional Logic:
Given an array of numbers, create a new array where each number is replaced by "even" if it's even, and "odd" if it's odd using map().

Mapping with Function Composition:
Given an array of strings, transform each string to uppercase and then append " - LENGTH: {length}" to each string, indicating its length, using map().

Mapping with Arrow Functions:
Rewrite any of the above examples using arrow functions within the map() method.




Filter by Property Value:
Given an array of objects representing products with name and price properties, filter out the products with a price greater than $50.
Filter by String Length:
Given an array of strings, filter out the strings that have a length greater than 5 characters.
Filter by Number Range:
Given an array of numbers, filter out the numbers that are greater than 100 and less than 1000.
Filter by Property Value with Condition:
Given an array of objects representing students with name, age, and grade properties, filter out the students who are younger than 18 and have a grade lower than 80.
Filter by Multiple Conditions:
Given an array of objects representing employees with name, age, and department properties, filter out the employees who are older than 30 and work in the "Sales" department.
Filter Unique Values:
Given an array of numbers, filter out the duplicate numbers, so the resulting array contains only unique values.
Filter Falsy Values:
Given an array containing various data types (such as strings, numbers, booleans, null, undefined), filter out the falsy values (e.g., empty strings, zero, false, null, undefined).
Filter by Array Intersection:
Given two arrays of numbers, filter out the numbers that are common to both arrays.
Filter by Array Exclusion:
Given two arrays of numbers, filter out the numbers that are present in the first array but not in the second array.
Filter by Regular Expression:
Given an array of strings, filter out the strings that match a specific regular expression pattern.



Some practical JavaScript interview questions related to promises and arrays:

1. Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns a promise that resolves with the sum of all numbers in the array.
2. Create a function that accepts an array of promises and returns a promise that resolves with an array of their resolved values.
3. Implement a function that takes an array of URLs and fetches them asynchronously using promises, returning a promise that resolves with an array of response data.
4. Write a program to filter an array of numbers asynchronously using promises, returning a promise that resolves with the filtered array.
5. Create a function that accepts an array of file paths and reads them asynchronously using promises, returning a promise that resolves with an array of file contents.
